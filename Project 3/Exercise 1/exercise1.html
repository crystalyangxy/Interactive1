    How Privacy Became a Commodity <br>for the Rich and Powerful
    </div>
    <div class="par">
    I found this article is really interesting because recently I read another<br>
    similar article about how google using our browsing history to decide which<br>
    advertisement should follow us across the web and they will get money on<br>
    how many times we click on that advertisement. The more we click on, the<br>
    more similar advertisement will show up on our browser. I found It is very<br>
    scary when I think carefully about there is a “person” spying my privacy and<br>
    browse history all the time, meanwhile, they used our information to get<br>
    amount of money.<br><br>

    As my personal experience, I also have many similar experience as what the<br>
     author wrote in this article that people search Google for a new pair of<br>
     shoes, and for a time, sneakers follow us across the web, tempting people<br>
     from every sidebar. At the beginning of this semester, I just start to learn<br>
     coding, and I searched many things about some technical question on google.<br>
     In that time, my browser always have some advertisement about the web teach<br>
     coding or the application for coding.<br><br>

     What if not only our privacy and browse history be monitored, but the<br>
     information we text to friends online are also be monitored? Then these<br>
      apps which we usually chat on may sell our private conversation to more<br>
      companies. In that case, even though we are not post our thought online<br>
      or search the product or information, these people who are watching us all<br>
      the time still know what are we think about and what we need in that period.<br>
       They will catch every chance to make money about our online conversation.<br>
       Then, the online advertisements will not only show what you search but<br>
       also show about what you think about.<br><br>
    </div>
    <div class="proposal">
    Proposal 1: <br>
    I could build a page that shows a conversation with friends and some <br>
    advertisement going around. Every time we reload the page, the advertisement <br>
    will change as the conversation change. The conversation page may put in the <br>
    middle, and advertisement are on the side.<br><br>
    Proposal 2:<br>
    I could using html with photos to show that these social software platform <br>
    are selling our conversation to get money.<br>
